<h1>SkyTemple Error Reports Privacy</h1>

<p>
If you enable error reporting you help us greatly in improving SkyTemple!<br>
We solely collect this data for the purposes of error reporting and anonymous usage statistics*.
</p>

<p>The data is sent to sentry.io for analysis. You can find <a href="https://sentry.io/share/issue/5b7226fe778147629cd5de3519855ca1/">an example error report here</a>. The error report also contains logs and information about the application state and some basic information about your system, these are not shown in the link, but you can view a preview of that <a href="/privacy.pdf">here</a>. Additionally you can <a href="https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/blob/master/skytemple/core/sentry.py">look at the source code of the module that collects the data</a>.


<p>*And these statistics are collected solely because I'm a stats nerd, I'm not selling them or anything - Para</p>
