Where are the sprites?
----------------------

To get all of the Pok√©mon sprites, you need to run a Python script to extract all sprites
and the metadata info JSON file ``sprites.json``:

https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/blob/master/skytemple_files/graphics/wan_wat/dbg/dungeon_bg_sprites_test.py

You will probably need to adjust the paths in that script. Place all files output by it into
this directory.
